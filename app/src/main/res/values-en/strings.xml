    Each time you add an event to your diary, you gain or lose points towards your current level. For example, I did exercises - plus 0.1 to health. Closed an important deal - plus 0.1 to work. Etc

   Every day, with due effort, the wheel will straighten its edges more and more. That\'s the point of Get Better.

           Here you get 3 strategic advantages over yesterday\'s self:\n\n
             1. You roughly imagined for yourself what 10 out of 10 is in a particular area
             \n\n2. You realized that there is room to develop and grow, what to improve right now
             \n\n3. You saw which areas you lag behind the rest, and this does not allow you to be completely perfect
        </item>
        <item>
           Remember what 10 out of 10 is for the area you are setting a goal for.
            \n\nNow visualize it. What can you do today to make this picture/feeling a little closer to you in reality?
            \n\nIf you dream of perfect health, your goal could be "run a marathon in 2022", or anything that brings you closer to your desired 10 out of 10.
            \n\nWe recommend that you move towards your goal in stages, like "run 5 km in 30 minutes", then "run 10 km in 55 minutes". So you will have a feeling of victory much more often, and this is an insanely important component of moving forward.
        </item>
        <item>
            To do this, you can select the date of the first execution and select the record type "habit", specifying the repetition interval.
             \n\nWhen a "habit" is completed, it will reappear on the desired date.
             \n\nWe already know how to make this more convenient and will include it in future updates, including the ability to select days of the week.

        <item>
          Start by rating all areas of your life from 1 to 10 on a satisfaction scale.
             \n\n1 means you are very dissatisfied, it couldn\'t get any worse, and 10 is an ideal, almost unattainable, but still possible.
             \n\nYou can also create your own spheres of life by customizing the wheel for yourself.
        </item>
        <item>
           When creating or editing a post, you may notice a slider.
             Here you can choose whether the recording improves, worsens or does not affect the performance of your area of life.
             \n\nThe indicator changes according to the selected difficulty level in the settings.
        </item>
        <item>
          Let\'s take us as an example: for us, 10 out of 10 in Career is "Get Better use more, Facebook feed for an hour, we have a huge office in the heart of Silicon Valley, we have helped more than 1 billion people live the life they want, and launched powerful wave.
             \n\nThis is not a goal, give yourself free rein, this is your beacon, you can dream big here. At the same time, 10 out of 10 in the Friends realm might sound like "2 real friends we see every week."
             \n\nYou get the idea, 10 depends on your ambitions in this area, and individually for you personally.
